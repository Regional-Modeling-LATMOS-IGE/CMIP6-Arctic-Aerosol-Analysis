# Downloading script's dev branch

Developing a downloading script for the whole CMIP6 data and an example for reproducibility

## Content of the repository for this branch

The folder */utilities* holds the different scripts used to download and pre-treat the CMIP6 data used for this analysis.\
We are coding the example held in /utilities that is named *download-cmip6-example.ipynb*.

## Next steps

Coding a loop over all the needed models and experiments.\
Making the example more readable.\
Move the data to a not temporary folder and clean the mess I've made FROM PYTHON.
Start from a txt file that can be read by python.
