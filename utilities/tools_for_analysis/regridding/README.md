## Description of the submodule :

*regridding* is the submodule used for the regridding methods applied to the ensemble to generate ensemble maps.

This script contains the regridding methods allowing to generate a common coarse grid onto projecting the ensemble. It also allows for a regridding of intensive variables converted 
beforehand to an extensive variable to make the regridding actually conservative.
