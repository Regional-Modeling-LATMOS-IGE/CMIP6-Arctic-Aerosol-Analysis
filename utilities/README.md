### Download

The */download* folder contains the downloading and loading routines of the CMIP6 ensemble we use. The **intake-esgf** package ([https://github.com/esgf2-us/intake-esgf?tab=readme-ov-file](https://github.com/esgf2-us/intake-esgf)) is employed to download and load the CMIP6 datasets we need.
